In a startling revelation, the veil has been lifted off what activists and petitioners are calling the biggest scam in Independent India - the electoral bond saga. The demand for an independent Special Investigation Team (SIT) to delve into all facets of this now-defunct scheme resonates louder than ever.

Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, in a press conference, didn't mince words as he branded electoral bonds as the epitome of corruption. Drawing a parallel to previous scandals like 2G and coal, Bhushan emphasized the necessity of a Supreme Court-monitored investigation, citing the tangible money trails uncovered within the electoral bond system.

The Supreme Court's intervention, culminating in the annulment of the electoral bond scheme on February 15, marked a pivotal moment. Subsequently, the Election Commission's release of data provided by the State Bank of India (SBI) shed light on the intricate web of transactions. These alphanumeric codes, connecting donors to political beneficiaries, underscored the extent of potential malfeasance.

Bhushan's allegations further underscored the gravity of the situation. The revelation that companies donating over ₹1,751 crore secured contracts worth a staggering ₹3.7 lakh crore raises alarming questions. Equally concerning is the claim that companies embroiled in legal tangles contributed significantly to the ruling party, potentially compromising impartiality.

Prof. Jagdeep Chhokar's assessment reinforces the suspicion of a corporate-political nexus, long suspected but now substantiated by data. This fight, as he aptly puts it, has always been about transparency in electoral funding - a fight for accountability to the taxpayers whose money is ultimately at stake.

RTI activist Anjali Bharadwaj's observation regarding the predominance of high-denomination bonds, coupled with questions about the SBI's autonomy, further deepens the intrigue surrounding this scandal.

The electoral bond debacle isn't just about financial irregularities; it's about the erosion of democratic principles. It's a wake-up call for all citizens to demand transparency, accountability, and integrity in our electoral processes. As the clamor for justice grows louder, one thing is abundantly clear: the pursuit of truth and justice must prevail, regardless of the obstacles.
