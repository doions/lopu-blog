Dealing with narcissistic parents can be challenging for teenagers, but there are strategies that can help navigate this difficult situation:

1. **Set Boundaries:** Establish clear boundaries with your parents regarding what behavior is acceptable and what is not. Stick to these boundaries even if they try to manipulate or guilt-trip you.

2. **Stay Calm:** Narcissistic parents may try to provoke you or push your buttons. Stay calm and composed, and don't let their behavior affect your emotional well-being.

3. **Seek Support:** Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor about your experiences. Having someone to confide in can provide emotional support and validation.

4. **Focus on Yourself:** Instead of trying to change your parents, focus on taking care of yourself. Pursue your interests, hobbies, and goals independently of their approval or validation.

5. **Practice Assertiveness:** Assertive communication involves expressing your thoughts, feelings, and needs clearly and respectfully. Practice assertive communication techniques when interacting with your parents.

6. **Limit Contact if Necessary:** If your parents' behavior is consistently harmful or toxic, consider limiting your contact with them. This may involve spending less time with them or setting boundaries around communication.

7. **Seek Professional Help:** If you're struggling to cope with your parents' behavior, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support.

8. **Educate Yourself:** Learn more about narcissistic personality disorder and how it affects relationships. Understanding the underlying dynamics can help you navigate your interactions with your parents more effectively.

9. **Practice Self-Care:** Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being by engaging in self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, journaling, and spending time with supportive people.

10. **Remember You're Not Alone:** It's important to remember that you're not alone in dealing with narcissistic parents. Many people have similar experiences, and there are resources and support networks available to help you cope.

By implementing these tips and strategies, teenagers can better manage their relationships with narcissistic parents and prioritize their own well-being.
